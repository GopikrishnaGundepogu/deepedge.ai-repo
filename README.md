# Supervised Regression for Pixel Coordinate Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the coordinates (x, y) of a pixel with a value of 255 in a 50x50 grayscale image where all other pixels have a value of 0. The pixel with the value of 255 is randomly assigned in each image. We use deep learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to solve this problem.

## Repository Contents

- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full code for dataset generation, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies and their versions needed to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `images/`: Directory containing example images and visualizations of ground truth vs. predicted coordinates (created during notebook execution).
